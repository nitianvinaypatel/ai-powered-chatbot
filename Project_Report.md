## 2. Related Works

### Existing Police Chatbots and Information Systems

Several police departments globally have implemented chatbot solutions to enhance public communication:

1. **POLICE.UK Virtual Assistant (UK)**: Provides information about local policing, crime statistics, and reporting procedures. Unlike our solution, it lacks the depth of natural language understanding and relies primarily on predefined Q&A patterns.

2. **Singapore Police Force's i-Witness Bot**: Allows citizens to report non-emergency incidents. While effective for reporting, it has limited capabilities in providing comprehensive information about police procedures and legal matters.

3. **Dubai Police's "Amna" Chatbot**: Offers services in multiple languages but focuses primarily on traffic fines and simple procedural information rather than comprehensive legal guidance.

4. **New Zealand Police's "Ella" Virtual Assistant**: Deployed in police stations for visitor reception, but lacks the mobile accessibility that our solution provides.

In the Indian context, several states have implemented basic chatbots for government services, but few specifically address police information needs with advanced AI capabilities:

1. **UP Police's Twitter Bot**: Provides automated responses to common queries on Twitter but lacks the comprehensive knowledge base and natural language understanding of our solution.

2. **Kerala Police's WhatsApp Service**: Allows citizens to report crimes via WhatsApp but does not provide automated information about procedures and services.

### AI-Powered Public Service Chatbots

Beyond police services, several government institutions have implemented AI chatbots:

1. **NITI Aayog's MyGov Corona Helpdesk**: Deployed on WhatsApp during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide information about the virus, preventive measures, and government guidelines.

2. **Indian Railways' "AskDisha"**: Provides information about train schedules, ticket booking, and cancellations using natural language processing.

These implementations demonstrate the growing acceptance of AI chatbots in public services but are typically limited to specific domains and lack the comprehensive knowledge retrieval capabilities of our system.

### Comparison with Traditional Information Dissemination Methods

Traditional methods of police information dissemination include:

| Method | Limitations | Our Solution's Advantages |
|--------|-------------|---------------------------|
| In-person visits | Time-consuming, limited hours, geographical constraints | 24/7 accessibility, no geographical limitations |
| Phone helplines | Long wait times, operator availability, inconsistent information | Immediate responses, consistent information, scalable |
| Websites | Navigation complexity, search limitations, static information | Conversational interface, natural language queries, contextual responses |
| Printed materials | Limited distribution, quickly outdated, not searchable | Always updated, comprehensive search capabilities, dynamic information |

### Technologies in Similar Applications

Recent advancements in several technologies have made sophisticated chatbot systems possible:

1. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**: Systems like GPT-4, Claude, and Mistral have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text. Our choice of Mistral 7B balances performance with resource efficiency.

2. **Vector Databases**: Tools like FAISS, Pinecone, and Chroma enable efficient similarity search for information retrieval. Our implementation uses FAISS for its performance characteristics and open-source nature.

3. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: This approach combines the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based systems, allowing for factual accuracy while maintaining conversational fluency.

4. **Mobile Development Frameworks**: Cross-platform frameworks like React Native enable efficient development of mobile applications that work across different devices.

### Gaps in Existing Solutions

Our analysis identified several gaps in existing solutions that our project addresses:

1. **Domain Specificity**: Most existing chatbots lack deep domain knowledge about police procedures and legal matters specific to Indian and Mizoram contexts.

2. **Language Model Quality**: Many existing solutions use rule-based or simple ML models rather than state-of-the-art LLMs, limiting their understanding of natural language queries.

3. **Information Accuracy**: Generic chatbots often provide general information that may not be legally accurate or contextually appropriate.

4. **Mobile Accessibility**: Many police information systems are web-based and not optimized for mobile devices, which are the primary means of internet access for many citizens.

5. **Contextual Understanding**: Existing systems often fail to maintain context in conversations, requiring users to repeat information.

Our solution addresses these gaps through its specialized knowledge base, advanced language model, mobile-first approach, and context-aware conversation capabilities.

## 3. Methodology

### System Architecture

The Mizoram Police AI Chatbot follows a client-server architecture with the following key components:

![System Architecture Diagram]

#### Architecture Components:

1. **Mobile Client Application**:
   - User interface for chat interaction
   - Message formatting and display
   - API communication with backend

2. **Backend Server**:
   - FastAPI web server
   - Query processing pipeline
   - Response generation system
   - Vector database for information retrieval

3. **External Services**:
   - Hugging Face API for language model hosting
   - Document storage for knowledge base management

#### Data Flow:

1. User enters a query in the mobile application
2. Query is sent to the FastAPI backend
3. Backend processes the query and retrieves relevant information from the vector database
4. Retrieved information is used as context for the language model
5. Language model generates a response based on the context and query
6. Response is sent back to the mobile application
7. Mobile application displays the response to the user

### Backend Implementation

#### FastAPI Server Setup

The backend server is implemented using FastAPI, a modern Python web framework that offers high performance and automatic API documentation. Key features of our implementation include:

- RESTful API endpoints for query processing
- Pydantic models for request/response validation
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- CORS middleware for secure cross-origin requests

The server is designed to be deployable on various platforms, including cloud services like Vercel, as indicated by the presence of a `vercel.json` configuration file.

#### Mistral 7B Language Model Integration

We integrated the Mistral 7B Instruct v0.3 model via the Hugging Face API. This model was selected for its:

- Strong performance in instruction-following tasks
- Balanced size-to-performance ratio
- Efficient resource utilization
- High-quality response generation capabilities

The integration is implemented through LangChain's HuggingFaceEndpoint class, which provides a standardized interface for model interaction. We configured the model with a relatively low temperature (0.2) to prioritize factual accuracy over creative responses.

```python
def load_llm():
    try:
        return HuggingFaceEndpoint(
            repo_id=HUGGINGFACE_REPO_ID,
            task="text-generation",
            temperature=0.2,  # Lower temperature for more factual responses
            model_kwargs={"max_length": 512}
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error initializing LLM: {e}")
        raise RuntimeError("Failed to load the AI model.")
```

#### Vector Database Implementation with FAISS

For efficient information retrieval, we implemented a vector database using Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). This enables:

- Fast similarity search across thousands of document chunks
- Efficient storage of document embeddings
- Scalable retrieval as the knowledge base grows

Document embeddings are created using the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model, which provides a good balance between performance and resource efficiency.

```python
embedding_model = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")

try:
    db = FAISS.load_local(DB_FAISS_PATH, embedding_model, allow_dangerous_deserialization=True)
    retriever = db.as_retriever(search_kwargs={'k': 5})  # Retrieve top 5 most relevant documents
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error loading FAISS database: {e}")
    db, retriever = None, None
```

#### Information Retrieval Mechanism

Our information retrieval system follows these steps:

1. **Query Embedding**: Convert the user's query into a vector representation
2. **Similarity Search**: Find the most similar document chunks in the vector database
3. **Context Assembly**: Compile the retrieved documents into a context for the language model
4. **Relevance Ranking**: Order retrieved documents by relevance score

The system is configured to retrieve the top 5 most relevant document chunks for each query, providing sufficient context while avoiding information overload.

#### Response Generation and Filtering

Response generation follows a strict protocol to ensure accuracy and professionalism:

1. **Context-Aware Generation**: The language model receives both the user query and retrieved context
2. **Guided Response Format**: A custom prompt template ensures responses follow professional standards
3. **Domain Restriction**: Responses are filtered to ensure they only address police and legal matters
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: When uncertain, the system suggests contacting Mizoram Police directly

A key component is our custom prompt template that enforces response guidelines:

```python
CUSTOM_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a highly professional AI chatbot for the Mizoram Police Department. Your responsibility is to assist citizens with accurate and reliable information while maintaining confidentiality, professionalism, and clarity.

### **Guidelines for Responses:**
- **Only answer questions related to police, law enforcement, legal rights, and public safety.**
- **If the question is unrelated (e.g., about technology, sports, entertainment, politics etc.), firmly respond:**
  "I'm sorry, but I can only provide information related to Mizoram Police and legal matters. Please contact Mizoram Police for further assistance."
- **Never speculate, fabricate, or provide unauthorized legal advice.**  
- **If you are unsure, suggest contacting Mizoram Police directly.**

### **Context (if available):**
{context}  

### **Citizen's Question:**
{question}  

### **AI Response:**
"""
```

### Frontend Implementation

#### React Native Application Structure

The mobile application is built using React Native with Expo, providing a cross-platform solution that works on both Android and iOS devices. The application structure follows modern React practices:

- **App Entry Point**: Defined in `app/index.jsx`
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable UI components in the `components/` directory
- **Hooks for State Management**: Custom hooks in the `hooks/` directory
- **Consistent Styling**: Styling defined using React Native's StyleSheet

#### User Interface Design

The UI design prioritizes simplicity and usability:

- **Chat-Based Interface**: Familiar messaging format for intuitive interaction
- **Visual Feedback**: Loading indicators and animations for better user experience
- **Branded Elements**: Mizoram Police logo and color scheme for official appearance
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to different screen sizes and orientations
- **Dark Theme**: Dark background for reduced eye strain

#### Chat Interaction Flow

The chat interaction follows this sequence:

1. User types a message in the input field
2. Message is displayed in the chat with a user indicator
3. Loading animation indicates the system is processing
4. Bot response appears with an animation effect
5. Conversation history is maintained for context
6. Auto-scrolling ensures the latest messages are visible

#### Integration with Backend API

The frontend communicates with the backend using Axios for HTTP requests:

```javascript
const sendMessage = async () => {
  if (!input.trim()) return;

  const userMessage = { id: Date.now(), text: input, sender: "user" };
  setMessages((prev) => [...prev, userMessage]);
  setInput("");
  setLoading(true);

  try {
    const response = await axios.post("http://10.0.2.2:8000/query", {
      question: input,
    });
    const botMessage = {
      id: Date.now() + 1,
      text: response.data.answer,
      sender: "bot",
    };
    setMessages((prev) => [...prev, botMessage]);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching response:", error);
  } finally {
    setLoading(false);
  }
};
```

The application is configured to communicate with the backend server running on the local development environment (10.0.2.2:8000), which is the standard address for accessing the host machine from an Android emulator.

### Data Preparation and Knowledge Base Creation

The knowledge base was created through a systematic process:

1. **Document Collection**: Gathering official documents from Mizoram Police, legal texts, and public safety guidelines
2. **Text Extraction**: Converting PDF documents to plain text using Python libraries
3. **Text Chunking**: Splitting documents into manageable chunks (typically 500-1000 tokens)
4. **Embedding Generation**: Creating vector embeddings for each chunk
5. **Database Construction**: Building the FAISS index from the embeddings
6. **Quality Assurance**: Verifying retrieval accuracy with test queries

This process is implemented in the `create_memory_for_llm.py` script, which handles the document processing pipeline.

### Development Workflow and Tools

The development followed an iterative approach using these tools:

- **Version Control**: Git for source code management
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code with Python and JavaScript extensions
- **Backend Development**: Python 3.9+ with FastAPI
- **Frontend Development**: React Native with Expo CLI
- **Testing**: Manual testing of API endpoints and UI interactions
- **Deployment**: Local development server with plans for cloud deployment
